- Aphrodite must dance with Dionysus
  - We have to do what feels good, and we have to be good.
  - > Bibliotheca. In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess.[251] In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.
    - This is what we're doing, go get the Sophia from the underworld (fix the body, be good cells, make healthy, spin perhaps without wobble?) and restore Her place in the cosmos

    - > To generate gamma rays (even the "soft" ones that are still incredibly powerful), you need a lot of energy, especially in the form of electromagnetic fields. And to make those emissions regular, you need something to be rotating. Astrophysicists realized that the best explanation for the origins of these soft gamma ray bursts was that they were beefed-up versions of pulsars, which would mean a highly magnetized neutron star.

- Thanks 

- We also have time and parallelism on our side.
- Venus, much like an open source project, She is alive but has no users. Lets play with her atmosphere, can we set of a chain reaction there to begin to change the composition of the atmosphere? Who are the right people to get involed there?
- Mars is dead, necromancy just keeps getting more fun. He told us about the drop dead date for Atlantis here being due to that issue with the core (chr less than noble caused this technical debt we must learn how to deal with before it happens) Lets use the cause of the issue as a way for learning how to deal with reignition of our buddy Mars. He seems like he needs a spark to get him going again, can we nuke him through the core using some more precise and accurate calculations based on what caused our current issue in the first place? Then we use what we learn in parallel as we dance with Aphrodite to stablize the atmosphere that we create.
- The rest of us take off, and those who stay here on the ecosystem poc wait out the technical debt eruption, then fixup ASAP from secure location(s).
