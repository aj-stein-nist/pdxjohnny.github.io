He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess.[251] In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus both must prove his godhood to mortals, then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.
